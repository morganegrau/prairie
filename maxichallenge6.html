      "The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 18th and early <br> 19th centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of sheet musix "The availability<br>of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music<br> pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur music<br> makers, who could play and sing popular music at home. In addition to the influence of sheet<br> music, another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century <br>of public popular music performances in "pleasure gardens and dance halls, popular theatres <br> and concert rooms."The early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet <br> music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to<br> attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind, who toured the US in the <br> mid-19th century. During the 19 th century, more people began getting involved in music by<br> participating in amateur choirs or joining brass bands.<br>

        <h20 class="h">In Every Work of Genius We Recognize Our Own Rejected Thoughts</h20><br><h21 class="ha">by Brody Vercher  on December 12, 2014</h21>
      <p class = "sub"> 
      I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not <br> conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may.<br> The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your <br> own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that is <br> genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due <br> time becomes the outmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the <br> Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to <br> Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what<br> men, but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which<br>flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages.<br>Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we<br> recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.<br> Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our<br>spontaneous impression with good- humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of<br>voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely<br> what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own<br>opinion from another.</p>
